# Digital Humanities 140: Coding for the Humanities
DH 140 Final Project

I'm starting out by brainstorming potential ideas for my final project, as well as gathering data visualizations and articles that I can take inspiration from. 

-----

Some data visualizations of interest below:

1. Link to original article: https://projects.propublica.org/hawaii-beach-loss/ 
   This article uses data science to analyze how Hawaii's beaches are disappearing over time and why that might be the case. I work closely with the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) community through the NHPI Data Policy Lab, and the way this article displays and explains Hawaii's beach losses provide inspiration on what I would want to do in my own work. 
   
2. Data visualization below: Religious demographics of South Africa, 2016

I would love to know how to make a visualization like this in Python since I'm interested in map visualizations looking at demographic variables such as religion, health status, and income. I've made a few in the past in Tableau but would like to explore how it works in Python as well. 

-----

From there, I brainstormed some general topic ideas to investigate as well. I listed them below, adding in lesson plans that I thought would be useful for getting there. 

1. Humanities topics that interest me: 
    * Social determinants of health (race, income, etc.)
    * Politics and demographics
    * Diversity of religion and income/economy
 
2. Getting Data: Web Scraping and APIs in Week 5 appeals to me the most because that is something I've been actively working on learning more about, especially with side projects outside of class. I am interested in using APIs to better streamline data storage (and not have to download millions of rows of data to my local computer), and I've been working with Census data and want to learn more about mastering Census APIs.

3. * Census Infographics and Visualzations: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations.html
   * Census Bureau data: https://data.census.gov/
   * Census APIs: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html
   * Social Vulnerability Index (based off Census data): https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/interactive_map.html
   * Healthy Places Index (looks at social determinants of health): https://www.healthyplacesindex.org/

I also looked for idea inspiration from curated datasets & project lists provided in class. They are also listed below and will hopefully help me to narrow down my own scope of research in my final project.
